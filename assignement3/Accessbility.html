                    Our way to make a website started from Figma, where we started to design our website. <br> One of adjustments we did from start was to create pages where you have space on both sides of page.<br> We decided to have information on center and space on sides. Reason to that was that when you go to other <br>website,  you can see that they have same thinking, example Olivia restaurant. <br> In additional, it works on mobile and computer website, where you get information downwards.<br> It does it very much easier and make website more open smooth to go through. <br> You can example of how one of our pages look while on Iphone 8 plus screen.

                    <p> All our pages in the website are connected with background images, logos, images <br> added on pages. It makes our page more customized depends on how you open our page. We used <br> Wave accessibility website to get feedback on what can be done better on our page. <br> On thing we got feedback on was to add label and remove justified text on our booking page. In additional we had to add on <h1> tag. </p>
