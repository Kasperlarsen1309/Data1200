                            Our way to make a website started from Figma, where we started to design our website. <br> One of adjustments we did from start was to create pages where you have space on both <br>sides of page. We decided to have information on center and space on sides. Reason to that<br> was that when you go to other website, you can see that they have same thinking, <br>example Olivia restaurant. In additional, it works on mobile and computer website, where you<br> get information downwards.According to vawe it do not check size screen to different devices, <br> but that was something we had to manage self to customized to our website. It does it very<br> much easier and make website more open and smooth to go through. Here is, <br> example of how one of our pages look while on Iphone 8 plus screen.

                    <div class="paragraph2"> 
                        <p> All our pages in the website are connected with background images, logos, images <br> added on pages. It makes our page more customized depends on how you open our page.<br> We used  Wave accessibility website to get feedback on what can be done better on our page. <br> On thing we got feedback on was to add label and remove justified text on our booking page. <br>In additional we had to add on h1 tag. </p>
