                    Our way to make a website started from Figma, where we started to design our website. One of adjustments we did from start was to create pages where you have space on both sides of page. We decided to have information on center and space on sides. Reason to that was that when you go to other website, you can see that they have same thinking, example Olivia restaurant. In additional, it works on mobile and computer website, where you get information downwards. It does it very much easier and make website more open smooth to go through.
